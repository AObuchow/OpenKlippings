# OpenKlippings
Open Source Java app for organizing Kindle clippings by book title.
# Why use OpenKlippings?
By default, on the Amazon site you can only see your Kindle notes and highlights in an organized manner for Amazon-bought books.

OpenKlippings allows you to sort through your Kindle notes and highlights by exporting them to a seperate text file, regardless of whether they were purchased from Amazon or not.
