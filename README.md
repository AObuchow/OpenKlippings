# OpenKlippings

Open Source Java app for organizing Kindle clippings by book title.
# Why use OpenKlippings?
By default, on the Amazon site you can only sort through your Kindle notes and highlights by title for Amazon-bought books. For all other documents, this information is added to a singular `MyClippings.txt` file which can quickly become lengthy and difficult to naviguate.

OpenKlippings allows you to sort through your Kindle notes and highlights by exporting each title to a seperate text file, regardless of whether they were purchased from Amazon or not.

# Dependencies
- [Java Development Kit (JDK) 8](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html)
